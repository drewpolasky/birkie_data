Birkie and Kortie results and some plots

Example usage:
python birkie_data_plotting.py  --tech skate --length birkie --plot byWave


Linking skiers from year to year:

python athlete_linking.py                         writes linked_data/linked_results.csv and linked_data/athletes.csv
python athlete_linking.py --name "drew polasky"   prints one skier's linked history

`results_loader.py` reads every file in yearly_data/ (four different formats since 2009) into one table.
`athlete_linking.py` gives each result an `athlete_id`. There are no ids in the results, so it matches on name
(with nicknames like Drew/Andrew), birth year (age group 2016-2020, exact age 2021+), gender, middle initial
(2009-2014) and hometown, and never on finish times. Each result also gets a `link_score` (log odds of its strongest
link) and `name_shared` (how many athletes share that exact name), to filter out shakier links in an analysis.


Year to year performance changes:

python performance_changes.py --race birkie --tech skate                        writes graphs/birkie_skate_year_to_year.png
python performance_changes.py --race birkie --tech skate --name "drew polasky"  also plots one skier, adjusted for conditions

`performance_changes.py` models log(finish time) as the skier's ability + that race's conditions + age + experience,
fit within the same skiers from year to year. Age is held flat from 25 to 35 and learning is assumed done by the 5th
race, which is what lets conditions and aging be told apart. 2024 (short course) and the open track are left out.

Field strength of each race:

python race_strength.py         writes graphs/race_strength.png, linked_data/crossover_results.csv and linked_data/race_strength.csv

Skiers who have done several events (Birkie, Kortie, Haakon, skate and classic, open track) put every race on one scale:
one ability per skier across events, one effect per race for its course and snow, plus age and experience. Each
race's winner, median and spread are then quoted as % slower than the typical Birkie skate median finisher.
`crossover_results.csv` has every finish by a multi-event skier with % of median, % back of the winner and of the top 10.
The Haakon is shaky: many adults there are skiing with their kids rather than racing.

Snow at skiers' hometowns:

python snow_depth.py download --start 2023-01-01 --end 2026-03-31     daily SNODAS tars from NSIDC, October to March
python snow_depth.py build                                             writes snow_data/hometowns.csv and snow_data/hometown_snow_depth.parquet

SNODAS is NOAA's daily 1 km snow model for the lower 48 (NSIDC dataset G02158). `build` places every US hometown in
the results with the Census gazetteer and USGS place names (downloaded on first use), then reads snow depth out of the
daily tars (`--tars`, E:/snowdas_data by default) for every day October to March since January 2004. Each hometown
gets the depth in its nearest 1 km land cell (`depth_mm`) and the average over land within 10 km (`depth_10km_mm`).
Only cells that are land in every season are used, since SNODAS's lake and border mask changed in 2013. Results
join to `hometowns.csv` on city and state. Hometowns outside the lower 48 have no SNODAS data.


Does snow at home make for a faster Birkie?

python snow_effect.py       writes graphs/snow_at_home.png and linked_data/snow_performance.csv

Counts each skier's skiable days at home (4+ inches within 10 km) from November 1 to the day before the race, and adds
them to the year to year model, split into the town's normal winter and how far this winter was above or below it.
The race's conditions take out everything the whole field shared that year, so the winter effect comes only from
skiers whose winter at home was snowier or leaner than normal there, compared with skiers from other places in the
same race. A winter with 30 more skiable days than normal is worth about 0.4% (0.2-0.6%), well under a minute for a
3 hour skier. It holds for skate and classic, without the local skiers, for skiers who never moved, with every
definition of a skiable day, and with a time trend for each state. The following winter's snow, which can't have
helped (a placebo), shows no gain (-0.15%, -0.31 to 0.00). The gain is biggest in towns that normally get little
snow and for slower skiers, and close to zero in towns that already get 60+ days. Moving somewhere with 30 more
skiable days in a normal winter goes with being 1.7% faster, but that includes whatever else came with the move.
